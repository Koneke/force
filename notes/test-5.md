# Introductory notes
Okay, so after the last test, it seems that green was simply too pricy,
and had too weak statlines after the combat revamp. On top of that, sapling generation
was pretty severly lacking. The big changes here is
- Lifetender: 4e -> 2e
- Earthbreaker: 1/3 -> 2/3
- Green Reaper: Sac _any_ sapling, draw _1_ (from >2h, draw 2)
- Composter: May now spawn sapling on attack
- Seedsower: New, 0/1 1 drop that spawns a Sapling ETB
With this, green should hopefully be able to hit a bit harder, and actually combo off.

# Starting hands
p1
- reclaimant
- bob - dropped
- syl
- lifetender
- seedsower - dropped (other one + compost should be enough)
- seedsower
- composter
> NOTE: hm! actually want to keep almost everything, so seemingly the cards feel a lot more value now already; seedsower is actually _great_ in starting hand. I'm seeing combos here, so let's let green go second this time.

p2
- security - dropped
- lastborn
- triggerman
- dealer
- vandal
- exto - dropped
- scav
> NOTE: starting to wonder if 2e on turn 1 is too little; bump to 3? 2 pretty much just lets you play a card then nothing, 3e has potential for _something_ at least. wouldn't super-solve things in this draw, but hm. playing just a vandal and swinging for 3 + mill 2 isn't shabby i guess, but not particularly interesting, even if it sets up for a lastborn play next turn

# Game

## t1 p2 (note, p2 starting)
- add 2e to 2e
- no draw
- vandal [3] for 2e
  - vandal: etb mill 2 (security, agitator)
- vandal [3] into face for 3
  - p1 at 12
- pass

## t2 p1
- add 4e to 4ed
- draw: earthbreaker
> NOTE: earthbreaker almost seems weak effect-wise now, maybe 2e was a good level. good plays here though, like sower [3], put a sapling [4], syl [4] over sapling to go to 2/2, tender [5] (maybe everything should be moved over then actually) to boost syl to 3/3, sower trade vandal, swing for 3
- sower [2] for 1e (to 3e)
  - sower: etb spawn sapling [3]
- syl [3] (over sapling) for 1e (to 2e)
  - syl: replacing sapling, goes to 2/2
- tender [4] for 2e (to 0e)
  - syl boosted to 3/3
- sower [2] into vandal [3] for 1
  - both die
- syl [3] into face for 2
  - p2 at 12
- pass
> NOTE: yeah! this is more what a green turn should look like!

## t3 p2
- add 4e to 4e
- draw: exto
> NOTE: alright, let's think here; since we can swing at an exhausted (syl) we can guarantee a lastborn death (sapling onboard would be issues, since they block with 0 power! but it's clear now), but that'd essentially just mean paying 4e for... a vandal + 1 chip hit on tender or syl? there _is_ also the security in grave, but it's not a super appealing ressurect target. there's also some form of a play trigger + scav, sac scav with trigger to have 2e left to play lastborn, but lastborn couldn't do anything after, but would at least be out for next turn... hm. straight up exto is a play too, green kinda likes both of their board pieces. lastborn might be the play.
- lastborn [3] for 2e (to 2e)
- lastborn [3] into syl [3] for 1
  - lastborn dies, syl to /2
  - lastborn: etg, pay 2e (to 0e) play vandal [3]
    - vandal: etb, mill 2 (infil, lastborn)
- vandal [3] into face for 3
  > NOTE: yeah this was the play; green can trade with tender (but losing the lord bonus), or take a fairly hefty 3.
  - p1 at 9
- pass

## t4 p1
- add 4e to 4e
- draw: syl
> NOTE: ooh, peep the following: composter, swing into vandal, trade, spawn a sapling [5] next to tender [4] on attack, syl over [5], so syl gets +2/ from sapling health boosted by tender, and _then_ also goes +1/+1 from tender! all for 3e!
- composter [2] for 2e (to 2e)
- composter [2] into vandal [3] for 1
  - composter: attack trigger (oh that should actually be written as a trigger huh) spawn sapling [5]
  - both die
- syl [5] (over sapling) for 1e (to 1e)
  - syl: replacing sapling, goes to 3/2 (+2/)
  - boosted by tender to 4/3 (!!)
- syl [3] into face for 3
  - p2 at 9
- syl [5] into face for 4
  - p2 at 5
- pass
> NOTE: mmmhm, green is looking a lot healthier now; maybe even too much veggies? but I'd rather bump black up potentially

## t5 p2
- add 4e to 4e
- draw: vandal
> NOTE: ok, so we're definitely feeling the "no stacking energy effect" here on black, very similar options to early turns, but we have vandal, we have scav... vandal can trade out... ah, block from tender, hm. ah right, tender blocking any dies, which green probably doesn't want here, so removing syl [3] should be doable, especially given _either_ swing form scav/vandal kills. but does green just win after? hm, they kinda do, right? still the 4/3 up, lifetender up, that's lethal, not counting with playing anything else out. exto etb to kill one of green's choice would leave it able to block one, so could get rid of one (probably syl [3] right), trade out the big hit, to reset the board for a comeback turn after. maybe. would still have 4e, but trigger + scav would leave them at trigger on board and 2e for vandal, so... has to be an exto play right?
- exto [3] for 4e (to 0e)
  - exto: etb, green sacs one, syl [3]
> NOTE: exto needs to be around to block, so boring turn, but...
- pass

## t6 p1
- add 4e to 5e
- draw: reaper
> NOTE: right, so reclaimant the exto, swing with syl [5], obviously blocked by now sapling [3], then given only 5e, the biggest damage output is a tender boosted reclaimant at 3, and tender itself adding 1 (but probably not swinging). so black is safe! at the most important life... 1.
- reclaimant [3] for 3e (to 2e)
  - reclaimant: etb, replace exto [3] with sapling [3]
- syl [5] into face for 4
  - sapling [3] intercepts
    - sapling [3] dies
- reclaimaint [3] into face for 3
  - p2 at 2
- pass

## t7 p2
- add 4e to 4e
- draw: security
> NOTE: oh shit, is that the clutch? security + scav for 4e total means three blocks on board, order it right and green might not be able to kill! removing something would be _very_ useful here though, hm. swinging vandal into syl would kill if not blocked, if blocked, tender trades, so syl drops to 3/2 and reclaimant to 2/3, and there's one less body on board. if security then blocks two... hm, probably still dead. yeah black is kinda energy choked. if trigger was [quick] instead of [exhaust] it'd be a lot more money, cus then scav, trigger, sac scav, vandal, two blocks on board, that... still doesn't fix it. hm. yeah this might just be security + scav, go for three blocks, just let lifetender through.
- security [3] for 3e (to 1e)
- scav [4] for 1e (to 0e)
- pass

## t8 p1
- add 4e to 6e
- draw: earthbreaker
> NOTE: oh wait shit, green had 2e not 1e, yeah this kills.
- earthbreaker [2] for 3e (to 3e)
- earthbreaker [1] for 3e (to 0e)
- earthbreaker [1] into face for 2
  - scav [4] intercepts
    - earthbreaker [1] to /1
    - scav [4] dies
- earthbreaker [2] into face for 2
  - security [3] intercepts
    - earthbreaker [2] to /2
    - security [3] to /2
      > NOTE: hm, maybe security back to /5
- reclaimant [3] into face for 2
  - security [3] intercepts (blocker)
    - reclaimant [3] to /2
    - security [3] dies
- syl [5] into face for 4
  - game

# Exit notes

Okay, so green definitely seems more playable now. Might be partial fluke, but I think two more sources of saplings really kicked it to life. Lifetender might need to go to 3 cost though, _VERY_ pivotal. Or not boost attack, just the health boost was kind of the big thing here with insta-boosting saplings up a step. It was a cool play though, might wanna keep it for a bit. Black's statlines do seem a bit anemic, but if they're gonna remain glass-cannons, maybe it is that they need to lean even harder into that to threaten more serious face damage. To contrast to a later red, I could see red's thing being more pinging any creature, e.g. on attack, so red would be controlled damage vs pure force in black? Maybe. The energy choke is _so_ real though. Not sure how to solve, another generator? Sadist, xe x/x, whenever a creature dies gain 1e..? Doesn't seem crazy flavourwise or powerwise really, and should allow a lot more plays. Makes sense with black suiciding their creatures into the opponent too. Or, as noted, maybe trigger needs to have it's effect revamped. An ETB? A once per turn without exhausting? Unclear. Dealer seems a bit weak now too, not really any opportunities to play it since it takes a full turn of energy, for 2/3, and a slow, conditional card draw. I think drawing that card could have been relevant (hm, next draw for black would have been the third lastborn, that could be relevant). Either way, it seems the tables have turned in green's favor.
