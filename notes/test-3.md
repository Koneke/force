return
- 1x infiltrator
- 1x enforcer

t1 p1:
add 2e (to 2e) (energy, new notation)
scav for 1 (to 1e)
scav into face (p2 at 13)
- mill 1 (infiltrator)
pass

t2 p2:
add 4e (to 4e)
draw vandal
vandal for 2e (to 2e)
- mill 2 (security, enforcer)
diver for 2e (to 2e)
- return security to hand
diver into vandal
- both die
vandal into face (p1 at 12)
pass

t3 p1:
add 4e (to 6e) (getting spicy)
draw vandal
lastborn for 2e (to 4e)
lastborn into vandal
- both die
- lastborn etg, pay 2 (to 2e), summon infiltrator
vandal for 2e (to 0e)
- mill 2 (dealer, diver)
NOTE: oooh, there was a better order there, vandal first for the mill
vandal into face (p2 at 10)
infiltrator into face (p2 at 8)
pass

t4 p2:
add 4e (to 4e)
draw lastborn
NOTE: interesting considerations; enforcer can ping infiltrator dead, but is vulnerable to vandal after; lastborn can trade with vandal to summon enforcer, diver, or vandal, two etbs, hm. can swing security into vandal, but almost dead after, for 3 all in all, not the nicest. can just trade scav into vandal for a bonus mill 1, then infiltrator to infiltrator, or face..? if we assume here evasive is essentially flying, that and enforcer are the only ways here to take it down.
scavenger for 1e (to 3e)
scavenger into vandal
- mill 1 (triggerman)
- both die
diver for 2e (to 1e)
- return vandal to hand (NOTE: low attack in hand, vandal at 3 might be useful, also the mill)
diver into face for 1 (p1 at 11)
pass

t5 p1:
add 4e (to 6e)
draw lastborn
NOTE: hmm, lastborn into diver (bringing it to /1), to cheat out dealer? cost 4e, anything else in hand would trade, but could maybe then sac infil into diver to clear both, trigger dealer, draw one, be left with only dealer on field + evening out hand situation... or put the pressure on, summon vandal, into diver to clear, summon second infil, hit for four in the air, threatening kill next turn... yeah
vandal for 2e (to 4e)
- mill 2 (scav, dealer)
vandal into diver
- both die
infiltrator for 2e (to 2e)
infiltrator into face (p2 at 6)
infiltrator into face (p2 at 4)
pass

t6 p2:
add 4e (to 5e)
draw lastborn
NOTE: hm, almost obligatory to go enforcer, or infiltrator; enforcer could still do its thing next turn, whereas infil would trade into infil... if there is a next turn that is... enforcer summon + ping would be 4e (to 1e), leaving no other play, but no guaranteed kill on board + a body at 1/3 which is not too shabby.
enforcer for 2e (to 3e)
exhaust enforcer
- pay 2e (to 1e)
- ping infil for 2
  - dies
pass

t7 p1:
add 4e (to 6e)
draw enforcer
NOTE: ooh, this is actually nice, no obvious play; enforcer ping + lastborn would kill enforcer, but can't use lastborn's etg then, and can't play and ping with enforcer and afford security, which is not a kill either way. hm! enforcer, ping enforcer, lastborn, swing with infil? leave lastborn for next turn for almost guaranteed kill
enforcer for 2e (to 4e)
exhaust enforcer
- pay 2e (to 2e)
- ping enforcer for 2
  - to /1
lastborn for 2e (to 0e)
infil into face (p2 at 2)
pass

t8 p2:
add 4e (to 5e)
draw triggerman
NOTE: ooh, okay, we have plays; enforcer ping is cheaper now since already otb, so ping infil, play triggerman, sac enforcer (to 2e), lastborn into lastborn, or, hm, the vandal we picked up earlier?
exhaust enforcer
- pay 2e (to 3e)
- ping infil
  - dies
triggerman for 3e (to 0e)
exhaust triggerman
- sac enforcer
- gain 2e (to 2e)
vandal for 2e (to 0e)
- mill 2 (scav, exto) NOTE: that exto is spicy next turn with a lastborn play
vandal into enforcer
- both die
pass

t9 p1:
add 4e to 4e
draw lastborn
NOTE: oooooh shit, p2 misplayed, the lastborn was more important to kill!! it can cheat out an infil and win now!
lastborn into triggerman
- lastborn dies, triggerman to /1
- lastborn etg, pay 2 (to 2e), summon infil
infil into face for game!

NOTE: both players 8 cards left in deck; p1 ended at 11 life
