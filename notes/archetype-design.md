# Core roles

## Starter
Turn 1/2 play, gets you on the board, might do some preparation work. Should potentially have an exhaustion play to allow defending next round? (Just attack?)

## Generator
Primarily in place to generate resources. Kind of a starter, but not really meant to attack necessarily, more just create energy.

## Extender
Keep playing at the tail-end of the turn. Maybe requires something else done in the turn, or allows card draw, put bodies on the field, trigger things. Bridge from starter to payoff.

## Payoff
The big swing, why the deck exists. Convert gamestate into advantage. Should potentially if possible be positional to bring in that flavor?

## Consistency
Drawing, filtering, searching with conditions, etc. E.g. Draw 1 Discard 1. Searching should probably not be by name, but something else (stat line, cost, etc.) to avoid the "what the fuck is a Mikanko" problem.

## Interaction
Answer pieces. Removal, bounces, force-exhausts, positional disruption, etc.

## Protection
Answer-to-answer pieces. Counters, toughness boosts/heals, immunity granting, blockers.

# Archetype roles

## Identity card
Big flavor card. Anchor piece, lord, etc. Tells you what the deck is about.

## Roleplayers
Not the most interesting, vanilla-ish, but cogs in the machine to make the archetype flow.

## Bridge
Off-color or generic interaction. There to facilitate brewing and pivoting essentially.

# Mini-set guideline
- 2 starters
- 2 generators
- 2 extenders
- 1-2 payoffs
- 2 consistency pieces
- 2 interaction cards
- 1-2 protection options
- 1 identity card

= 14~16 cards
