security to face for 2
- mill 2
pass

T4 (P2):
add 3 energy to 3
NOTE: maybe security needs to go back to 1/4, can't really swing with anything in hand now without it dying, hm. consider a cost to p/t ratio? ofc add some value for effects too, but. but scav swinging here does nothing but put damage on and mill 1, trigger swinging dies, can't afford to play exto. if non-exhausted have to die before face, scav is a play (without attacking). let's try that as an approach, not a fan, but hm.

NOTE: maybe enforcer should be more sniper, shift the effect to exhaust ping for 2? if so there's a cool play here enforcer, exhaust to kill trigger, play trigger, sac enforcer, left at two energy, which, hm, not big pop-off, but kinda neat? let's pretend that's what the card does.
