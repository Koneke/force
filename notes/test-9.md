## t6 p2
- rest
- add 4e to 4e
- draw: breaker
  > NOTE: oh shit, aight, ok, lock in. breaker [2,2] for a draw to 2e, syl [2,1] to 1e but +2 so 3e, composter [1,1] over syl for free (countered by breaker), then another [1,3] over fieldhand paid for, then we have two... 2/3s on field, hm. not super swingy. but with 3e left over, and a bonus draw. can follow up with reclaimant too, or something else based on the draw. yeah, seems reasonable honestly.

  - p1 at 7
- pass

## t7 p1
- rest
- add 4e to 6e
- draw: security
> NOTE: hm, okay, there are some plays here. security is not a bad play, can take two hits, dealer can take one. security wont kill, but would put in enforcer range. the sadists could also be subsidized blockers, but... hrm, one of them has to die first, dealer wont, so it's only really one trigger, unless something happens. i was about to say lastborn, enforcer, ping lastborn with enforcer to get something back, but a bit so-so, also can't afford both triggers. but if we can keep at least lastborn on the field, there's space for something next turn at least maybe...
- [p1] security [1,3] for 3e (to 3e)
- [p1] enforcer [1,4] for 2e (to 1e)
- pass

## t8 p2
- rest
- add 4e to 4e
- draw: breaker
> NOTE: ok, so, rampage/watchman are both 4e, ramp doesn't work here, but watchman could at least trade over e.g. dealer. breaker to prep for next turn... but we kinda want to make sure black can't catch up here, a bit too close.
- [p2] nightwatchman [2,5] for 4e (to 0e)
  - (+1/+1 from neighbour effect so 3/2)
- [p2] watchman [2,5] into face for 3
  - [p1] dealer intercepts
    - both die
- [p2] composter [2,1] into face for 2
  - [p1] security [1,3] intercepts
    - composter [2,1] to /2, security [1,3] to /2
- [p2] composter [2,3] into face for 2
  - [p1] security [1,3] intercepts (*blocker*)
    - composter [2,3] to /2, security [1,3] dies
- [p2] reclaimant [2,4] into face for 2
  - [p1] enforcer [1,4] intercepts
    - reclaimant [2,4] to /2, enforcer [1,4] to /1
- pass

## t9 p1
- rest
- add 4e to 7e
- draw: triggerman
> NOTE: ok, we have plays here; sadist to 5, lastborn to 2, crash-, hm, no, wrong order. sadist to 5, trigger to 2, crash enforcer to 3, lastborn to 1, triggersac to 3, lastborn etg to 1 (grab... exto?).
> or... sadist to 4, sadist to 1, crash enforcer to 3, lastborn to 1, crash lastborn to 3, etg to 1. hm, i wonder if there's an order here where we can both trigger and sadist..? trigger, sadist to 1, sac enforcer to 4, lastborn to 2 (+1 so 3), crash, etg. hm. i guess the diff here is what we leave on board; trigger is stronger, but sadists with blockorder... hm, no, exto wouldn't die blocking, hrm.
> enforcer pop something to 5, trigger to 2, lastborn to 0, triggersac lastborn and etg exto, two rested bodies on board and two dead from the opponent. interesting turn.
- [p1] enforcer [1,4] exhaust for 2e (to 5e)
  - 2 damage to watchman [2,4]
    - watchman [2,4] dies
- [p1] triggerman [1,3] for 3e (to 2e)
- [p1] triggerman [1,3] opt
  - enforcer [1,4] sacced

  - [p2] intercepts with breaker [2,2]
    - lastborn [1,4] dies, breaker [2,2] to /2

- [p1] exto [1,4] into face for 4
  - p2 at 7

## t10 p2
- rest
- add 4e to 4e
- draw: syl
- [p2] breaker [2,3] for 2e (to 2e)
  - breaker [2,2]: neighbour etb, gain 2e (to 4e)
- [p2] syl [2,2] (shift) for 1e (to 3e)
  - syl [2,2]: *shift*, +1/+0 per neighbour (+2/+0) to 3/2
  - breaker [2,3]: neighbour etb, gain 2e (to 5e)
> NOTE: ok, no lethal on board; black probably doesn't wanna let syl through, so if they trade dealer there's only exto on board, + composter can trigger to raise itself to 3/3, or breaker to 2/4... 3/3 is more appealing to block exto, but would be exhausted. if syl goes through, can just stay up to block next turn and swing again... hm, would you even want to exhaust composter though? might just be better with two blockers up, even if weak... wait, shit, need syl to block exto, otherwise black will just clear with it over 2-3 turns. composter could swing exto, make one blockable by breaker if they swing... hrm. but then comp dies. is that an issue..? syl can trade exto (i mean, already can though), breaker... doesn't win over time to trigger. yeah, no, this is a pass
- pass

# Exit Notes

Ok, so, things are definitely feeling better for green. I still think black just has more value, but it's getting closer, and green is feeling a lot more playable. Some costs probably need to come down, some stats maybe up, but overall, it's looking pretty good! I don't end up feeling "shit, I need a sapling here", I just look at what I have and play. T6 felt really cool. There's a little oomph lacking, but yeah! Some card draw would probably be nice, and some more boosting potentially. Trample never became relevant, simply because green didn't have enough damage to trample over anything on black. Which, to be fair, could also mean that black is too beefy. Oh, forgot to mill for security, eh. Yeah, I think we've gone from "green is busted" in combat v1 (not due to the saplings really, but) to "green sucks ass" in combat v2, to "hey, it actually looks kinda even here". Maybe some more value, or ability to play another card or two from lower costs, or we make sure the energy ramps over time.
