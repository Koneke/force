# Introductory notes
This is the first test post revamped combat rules.
The summary is, that you no longer have to attack exhausted first.
The attacker can instead target face, OR, any exhausted creature.
The defender can decide to intercept with and non-exhausted.
This should leave more agency on the defender side,
while putting more face pressure on,
without removing the ability to target engine pieces on board.
The goal is to avoid the previous grindy/stally games.

## t4 p2
- add 4e to 6e
- draw: scav
> NOTE: hm, lastborn, swing into reclaim to bring it to /2, lastborn dies, pay etg to get trigger on board, at 2e, play lastborn, trigger lastborn (trigger gives 2e to pay for etg), get vandal?
- lastborn for 2e (to 4e)
- lastborn into reclaimant for 1
  > NOTE: ooh, but it's blockable! that fucks the entire play! :0 or, hm, wait, sequencing

  - lastborn dies, reclaimant to /2
    - pay lastborn etg (2e to 0e) to play trigger from gy

  > NOTE: ordering here is interesting, i guess energy gains first? but needs to be formalized at some point
  - add 2e (to 2e)
  - pay lastborn etg (2e to 0e) to play vandal from gy
    > NOTE: not cheating out at this point, but big swing to either threaten face harder, or hard-chip bob, hm
    - vandal etb mill 2 (scav, trigger)
- vandal into face for 3
  - p1 at 9
  > NOTE: went for face cus sitting on two infil for aerial
- pass

## t5 p1
- add 4e to 4e
- draw: green reaper
  > NOTE: yeah yikes, we need more sapling gen for this set to synergize with itself
> NOTE: misplay earlier by playing bob next to reclaimant, tender form hand here could boost both, be enough for bob to kill vandal with just the one; not changing it, just interesting. playing tender next to it would also put it at edge with less value. note to self, start logging monster position on play for later analysis; [x] where x is position seems good enough. tender between would mean bob can kill vandal and reclaimant could trade with trigger, but no can do now

> NOTE: generally a rough time here on green, lots of cards at cost 3 or so, so if you empty your reserves, you play _one_ card if you can't do earthbreaker shenanigans, they need cheaper drops.

> NOTE: roleplaying that i don't know black's hand here, i'd assume they don't have a nice one-drop to sac with trigger for gain, so vandal seems the bigger immediate threat
- lifetender at [1] for 4e (to 0e)
  > NOTE: lifetender should maybe come down to 3e
- bob into vandal for 1
  - vandal dies, bob to /2
- reclaimant into face for 2
  - p2 at 13
- pass

## t6 p2
- add 4e to 4e
- draw: diver
> NOTE: hm, diver for 2, get lastborn, play lastborn for 2, sac lastborn with trigger, get the second trigger, second trigger sac diver to gain 2, play scav? bigger statline than diver and a remaining energy; can trade with bob
- diver [3] for 2e (to 2e)
  - get lastborn from gy
- lastborn [2] for 2e (to 0e)
- exhaust trigger to sac lastborn
  - gain 2e (to 2e)
  - pay lastborn etg (2e to 0e) to play trigger [2] from gy
- trigger (2) sac diver
  > NOTE: hm, with position notation we might not need to number these, like chess
  - gain 2e (to 2e)
- scav [3] for 1e (to 1e)
- ~~scav into bob~~
  - scav: mill 1 (agitator)
  - both die
    > NOTE: NO! HOLD UP! lifetender gives one health too! hm, let's rethink. okay, redo; digital client would show upped health, so let's play around that.
- scav into reclaimant
  - scav: mill 1 (agitator)
  - both die
- pass

## t7 p1
- add 4e to 4e
- draw: syl
> NOTE: yeah hm, our damage output at all on green doesn't look great. it's not supposed to be _fantastic_, but right now it's... not good. would need to go three cards into a trigger, and only one that would survive is bob at /1. syl to 2/2 at least maybe? or, hm, that's strong at 1 cost. buff earthbreaker back to 2/3 with new rules is not insane, to match triggerman, given that they're kinda same role at same cost. reaper at 1/2 is anemic too, effect might not be good enough to counter that.
- bob [3] for 3e (to 1e)
- syl [4] for 1e (to 0e)
- bob [2] into trigger [2] for 1
  - bob [2] at /1, trigger [2] at /2
- syl [4] into trigger [2] for 1
  - syl [4] dies, trigger [2] at /1
- lifetender [1] into trigger [2] for 1
  - both die
  - lifetender leaving means bob [2] no longer has +1/+1, so it dies as well
- pass

## t8 p2
- add 4e to 5e
- draw: enforcer
> NOTE: obv play, p1's board only has one target, so exto, kill that, swing exto and trigger for 6
- exto [3] for 4e (to 1e)
  - exto [3] etb: p1 sacs bob [3]
- exto [3] into face for 4
  - p1 at 5
- trigger [4] into face for 2
  - p1 at 3
- pass

## t9 p1
- add 4e to 4e
- draw: earthbreaker
> NOTE: yeah, gg, can only play a single card, reaper does nada, mother does nada and can't afford, breaker is just a 1/3 until something hits next to it; i mean, p2 could have a dead hand (if we're roleplaying), so breaker is the obvious correct choice to block exto [3] since trigger [4] doesn't kill
- earthbreaker [3] for 3e (to 1e)
> NOTE: need to keep breaker up for blocking, pass
- pass

## t10 p2
- add 4e to 5e
- draw: dealer
> NOTE: straight kill swing; there's more cards in hand, but just exto swing, forced block or die, trigger sac exto, infil, infil, 4 in the air, even if there was another blocker
- exto [3] into face for 4 (game)
  - earthbreaker [3] intercepts
    - earthbreaker [3] dies, exto [3] to /2
- triggerman [4] exhaust to sac exto [3]
  - gain 2e (to 7e)
- infiltrator [3] for 3e (to 4e)
- infiltrator [2] for 3e (to 1e)
- infiltrator [3] into face for 2
  - p1 at 1
- infiltrator [2] into face for 2
  - game

# Exit notes

Okay, so, now that you no longer need to go through the exhausted, green just does _not_ have enough board presence. Previously they could just swing, survive the hit with their higher toughness, then tank a hit after. Now, they can't double-dip like that. And it's becoming apparent that

1. Green does not have the damage output to remove threats, or even be threatening when swinging face.
2. The sapling idea in green is great, but it's not synergistic currently. They need to be able to get them on board more.
3. Green's cards are generally too pricy, for their statline, for what they do, and for what they need. Earthbreaker _needs_ another card to be played or it's just not great value; Reaper is just a wimp without upside without a sapling (that's been on board for TWO turns!!); Mother is beefy, and at least swings for 2, but at 5e without upside unless there are sapling? HM.
4. SYL could be a chunky swinger, but again needs sapling, and SYL currently is kinda the "swing hard" thing in the deck, and it can't do it's job. It ends up being a "well I have 1e left over" or "I need a body to block".

My current proposals here would be
1. Find more ways for green to spawn saplings, or kill the concept.
2. Tweak stats, tweak costs, give green more value. Might need some stat tweaks across the board really, given that exhausted targets have gone from a _MUST KILL_ to _POTENTIAL TARGET_; e.g., maybe Trigger doesn't need 3 health, if it's no longer necessary to walk through it. Etc.
3. Introduce a new green concept of giving +1/+1, or +1/+0, or something. Mesh with tweaking the stats. A 1 or 2 drop that gives out a +1/+1 or two would immediately make them more of a threat with otherwise wimpy stats.
4. Consider introducing actions, to allow green with it's limited boardspace to still interact with it.
  - Not necessarily a fan of doing this already, since we just revamped combat, might need some iterating.
