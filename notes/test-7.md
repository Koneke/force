# Introductory notes

Alright, so this is the first test with action cards, so expect things to be busted. IIRC, last thing we did was nerf sadist so it only triggers on friendlies, might still be busted. The other big difference here is that the board is 6 wide as a test. I noted that it might be hard to follow the positional annotations (e.g. [1]) without a side indicator, so let's do [1,X] for p1, and [2,X] for p2. Damn am I gonna get tired of writing that, but hey, logging is good.

But yeah, action cards, let's see 1. if we managed to get the power level ok on them and 2. if it solves some of the board clog issues, without churning the hand too hard. 8 per deck now, added on top of the rest, so total of 30 per now. Starting to hti more "real" deck sizes.

# Game

## t1 p1
- add 2e to 2e
  > NOTE: yeah, hm, the 2e at t1 is starting to feel worse and worse over time
- no draw
- syl [1,6] for 1e (to 2e)
- pass

## t2 p2
- add 4e to 4e
- draw: dealer
- vandal [2,4] for 2e (to 2e)
  - vandal [2,4]: etb, mill 2 (dealer, enforcer)
- shady dealings for 2e (to 0e)
  - shady dealings: pay 2 life (p2 at 13), draw 2 (diver, lastborn)
- ~~vandal [2,4] into syl [1,5] for 3~~
  > NOTE: ah, wait, i don't think we ever changed that you can swing into rested; i think that's still something to consider, considering how easy it was to keep sadist up last game, but we do have more removal and similar available now
- vandal [2,4] into face for 3
  - p1 at 12
- pass

## t3 p1
- add 4e to 5e
- draw: rampage
> NOTE: hm, i wanna reclaimant syl to get a sapling to thornbite with it, but it's not a great play here/now. i kinda wanna just to try, but maybe it's time for patience...
- earthbreaker [1,3] for 3e (to 2e)
- pass

## t4 p2
- add 4e to 4e
- draw: mercy kill
> NOTE: oof, had green not been so afraid of swinging here (due to wanting to use earthbreaker next turn, so keeping syl for blocking for it... well, right, it couldn't be targeted because not exhausted, but) that's a killin'
- dealer [2,3] for 3e (to 1e)
  - dealer [2,3]: etb, mill 2 (agitator, scav), draw 1 (mercy kill)
- vandal [2,4] into face for 3
  - syl [1,6] intercepts
    - both die
      - dealer [2,3]: exhaust, draw 1 (infil)
> NOTE: ooh right, mercy kill is a quick; hm, if i held energy up i could maybe have sniped something on their turn
- pass

## t5 p1
- add 4e to 6e
- draw: breaker
> NOTE: hm, i wanna reclaimant [1,4] trigger breaker rampage or something, but breaker just giving 1e is definitely ending up looking kinda weak... we could claimant, exhaust breaker, thorn-, right no, need a sapling; depends on the ordering here really; could i play reclaimant next to breaker, use breakers trigger to exhaust and gain 1e and THEN turn it into a sapling, or does the etb need to resolve first? hm. my brain is saying they're... ah right, not both mandatory, only reclaimant's is. in yugi rules we'd do all mandatory at the same time, order those, then optional, order those, but that doesn't help us here either way. in magic... unsure? ah, apnap. right, so ap puts all on stack in whatever order, then nap, in their order. so in this case, since they're both on "enter", we should be able to order them..? i mean the play doesn't work either way here, but interesting rabbit hole. short on saplings, and definitely short on boosted saplings to kill with bite.
- reclaimant [1,4] for 3e (to 3e)
  - earthbreaker [1,3]: exhaust to gain 1e (to 4e)
  - reclaimant [1,4]: etb, replace dealer [2,3] with sapling
- bob [1,5] for 3e (to 1e)
- pass

## t6 p2
- add 4e to 5e
- draw: resuscitate
  > NOTE: hm, the mill 2 is adding some extra value, to compete with diver, but maybe make it any card instead of just creature..? or 1 cost creature, introduce another 2 cost any? worth thinking about.
> NOTE: okay, i kinda wanna mercy kill of earthbreaker, even tho it's kinda low value. could guarantee lastborn dying tho by swinging into earthbreaker? no they can block with bob. thought was guarantee kill on lastborn with mercy kill, but not enough energy for lastborn effect then, sour. yeah the lack of energy gain over time here is getting rough, might have to make it increase over time...
- resuscitate for 2e (to 3e)
  - mill 2 (sadist, resuscitate), return sadist
- sadist [2,4] for 3e (to 0e)
- pass

## t7 p1
- add 4e to 5e
- draw: thornbite
> NOTE: ouch, still no saplings, rough hand. oh, should rampage have [Quick]? or is that too tricky? but yeah, if we wanna swing with it here, that's 4e, that's pricy, and we don't really have enough damage output to do anything with it. maybe we need more growth spurt, lifetender, and similar in the deck for it to be threatening enough, or generally bump statlines. I think we're running into an issue here tho where statlines can't be too high, cus cards are cheap, but cards are cheap cus we keep being low on energy... they're very clustered on 2-3-4. well, black for sure doesn't wanna let sadist die, so maybe we just swing here, no rampage, and hope for nicer skies next turn..? maybe breaker first discounted, rampage swing next turn..?
- breaker [1,2] for 3e (to 2e)
  - breaker [1,3]: exhaust, gain 1e (to 3e)
- breaker [1,2] into face for 2
  - sapling [2,3] intercepts
    - sapling [2,3] dies
      - sadist [2,4]: gain 1e (to 1e)
- reclaimant [1,4] into face for 2
  - p2 at 11
- pass

## t8 p2
- add 4e to 5e
- draw: sadist
> NOTE: ... double mercy kill, pass..?
- mercy kill for 2e (to 3e), ping breaker [1,2] for 3
  - breaker [1,2] dies
- mercy kill for 2e (to 1e), ping breaker [1,3] for 3
  - breaker [1,3] dies
- pass

## t9 p1
- add 4e to 7e
- draw: seedsower
> NOTE: OOOH, there we go! sower out, thornbite start of p2's turn to kill sadist!
- sower [1,3] for 1e (to 6e)
  - sower [1,3]: enter, play sapling [1,2]
- sower [1,3] into face for 1
  - p2 at 10
- reclaimant [1,4] into face for 2
  - p2 at 8
- pass
- sapling [1,2] grows to 0/2

## t10 p2
- add 4e to 5e
> NOTE: okay, so here's an interesting question: what is the first opportunity for p1 to thornbite here? before energy? before draw? before anything after that? hm, in magic, there's no prio in untap, but i guess in upkeep? i haven't formally done untap/rest, but i've conceptually had it before energy (which i guess is kinda upkeep, if it's not a dedicated step), so before draw would be the answer in magic, and i think in ygo you can play stuff in standy as well. hm, let's say after untap, energy, but before draw then. need to formalize a bit.
- [p1] thornbite for 2e (to 0e), sac sapling [1,2], deal 2 to sadist [2,4]
  - sadist [2,4] dies
  > NOTE: also, yeah, we really should annotate player actions as well now, so [p1] and [p2] at the start of the line
- draw: mercy kill
> NOTE: ooh, big threat play here i kinda disregarded before, diver for agitator
- [p2] diver [2,4] for 2e (to 3e)
  - diver [2,4]: enter, return agitator
> NOTE: yeah, that's really all we need to _really_ threaten green here; pretty thick grave, 7e next turn, yeah, pass
- pass

## t11 p1
- add 4e to 8e
- draw: tender
> NOTE: oof, had we been less sloppy with positioning before this would be more value. still not a lot, but. and yeah, black is drawing a _LOT_ now, more than they can play, green is sitting on a slim hand of 3 vs black's 8. tender can only boost by 1 here, rampage does nothing, cant thornbite. heck.
- [p1] seedsower [1,3] into face for 1
  - p2 at 7
  > NOTE: worth risking to get rid of it, and a diver at /2 is more removable. 1/3 is probably too strong for it. and even if black agitators next turn, we still have three blocks, so... hm. idk.
- pass

## t12 p2
- add 4e to 7e
- draw: triggerman
- [p2] agitator [2,5] for 6e (to 1e)
  - agitator [2,5]: enter, play vandal [2,1], dealer [2,2], sadist [2,3], banish enforcer, dealings, scav, dealer, resuscitate, resuscitate, mercy kill, mercy kill

  - vandal [2,6]: enter, mill 2 (exto, enforcer)
- vandal [2,6] into face for 3
  - p1 at 9
- pass

## t13 p1
- add 4e to 12e
> NOTE: yikes, yeah, not enough outlets on green; might need more draw, or there's too many bricks here.
- draw: tender
> NOTE: bruh. max swing here is 5, but two blockers up, black easily kill swings next turn, gg.
- [p1] resign

# Exit Notes

Okay, so, hm. Actions are cool, but thornbite might be too weak, rampage too pricy, dealings is probably busted and shit, maybe dealer didn't need draw on entry, just make the trigger a once effect instead of exhausting and it couldn't double dip as hard. or, go back to just with the exhaust, hm. but yeah black was sitting on a MASSIVE hand each game, and green is just sitting there short on cards and energy flooded, something is not working great. green for sure at least needs more saplings, again, if we're sticking with that idea, maybe it's dead in the water. maybe a 1 cost to spawn two, that'd actually be a threat, but pretty stally. saplings enter exhausted and don't unexhaust..? so they could at least be picked off? *Unevasive*? lol. but yeah, green is just not threatening.
