# Introductory notes

Okay, so black's been looking weaker, primarily energy choked, and a bit weak on statlines.
Key changes:
- Complex Sadist: 3e 1/2, whenever a creature dies gain 1e. Should help out dry turns and encourage sacs.
- Dealer: Down to 2e, etb mill 2, draw 1. 4e was pricy, effect was slow, so balance out with an etb and easier play.
- Triggerman: From [Exhaust] to [Once] (i.e. OPT). Might be too strong, especially with Sadist. But previously, using trigger (which we want) would lock it down to hard. Might be alleviated by rest though. Evaluate

# Game

## t1 p1
- add 4e to 4e
- no draw
- sower [1] for 1e (to 3e)
  - sower: etb, play sapling [2]
- reaper [3] for 3e (to 0e)
- exhaust reaper to sac sapling, draw 2 (...
> NOTE: oops, 2e on t1, not 4e. was about to say this seemed very strong. the tempo is kinda nice though... maybe consider turn 1 4e in the future, but no attack..? but okay, revert this turn.

## t1 p1 (revamped)
- add 2e to 2e
- no draw
- sower [1] for 1e (to 1e)
  - sower: etb, play sapling [2]
- syl [2] (over sapling) for 1e (to 0e)
  - syl: replacing sapling, goes to 2/2
- sower [1] into face for 1
  - p2 at 14
- syl [2] into face for 2
  - p2 at 12
- pass
> NOTE: decent start; i think the 4e version was maybe more interesting though, and yeah, ability to swing on turn 1 is maybe a bit wacky..? consider later.

## t2 p2
- add 4e to 4e
- draw: sadist
> NOTE: hmm, this is where we maybe see things being a bit bonkers
- sadist [3] for 3e (to 1e)
- scav [4] for 1e (to 0e)
- scav [4] into syl for 2
  - scav: mill 1 (security)
  - both die
  - sadist: death trigger, gain 1e (to 1e)
- scav [4] for 1e (to 0e)
- scav [4] into sower 
  > NOTE: hm, wait, no; could swing with sadist, keep scav to blo-, ah, no, as long as they don't summon anything. except, hm, sower can go into sadist safely, so it's if they get at least two two power-plusses on board... which _could_ happen. tricky at 4e maybe? especially for green? hmmmm. but also, what's the upside of doing that here..? scav to sower trades and gains 1e, or scav to face evens out life a bit... yeah, keep the sadist up and hard-to-remove. yeah let's go scav to sower.
  - scav: mill 1 (infil)
  - both die
  > NOTE: oh shit wait, that's two triggers! that's 2e!! that's _SIGNIFICANT_!
  - sadist: death trigger, gain 1e (to 1e)
  - sadist: death trigger, gain 1e (to 2e)
> NOTE: okay, could play lastborn, but for the why. maybe just pass
- pass

## t3 p1
- add 4e to 4e
- draw: reaper
> NOTE: no phenomenal plays here, three three costs in hand (reaper reaper bob) and fieldhand at 2, so only getting one thing out. maybe just bob and store an energy..? can at least block 2, and wont kill anything for sadist...
- bob [1] for 3e (to 1e)
- pass

## t3 p2
- add 4e to 6e
- draw: dealer
- dealer [4] for 3e (to 3e)
  - dealer: etb, mill 2 (sadist, lastborn), draw 1 (lastborn)
    > NOTE: hm, right play, didn't work out. another dealer and swing twice could work for good advantage or big chip on bob...
- dealer [4] into face for 2
  - bob intercepts
    - bob at /3
- dealer [5] for 3e (to 0e)
  - dealer: etb, mill 2 (trigger, exto), draw 1 (trigger)
    > NOTE: ah! sac outlet!
- dealer [5] into face for 2
  - bob intercepts
    - bob at /1
- pass
> NOTE: not a big combo turn or anything, but dealer feels significantly better at this level; gy is nice and thick now too for a potential lastborn play next turn, and triggerman to sac a dealer would gain 3e (!!) and generate a draw from the other dealer (!!)

## t4 p1
- add 4e to 5e
- draw: composter
> NOTE: okay, so no big swing plays here, but composter for sap, reaper, sac sap, draw 2 would be the turn, and could give better setup for next. still three bodies on board then, with the almost dead bob
- composter [5] for 2e (to 3e)
  - composter: etb, playing sapling [4]
- reaper [3] for 3e (to 0e)
- exhaust reaper to sac sapling [4], draw 2 (syl, fieldhand)
> NOTE: hm, was considering swinging with composter, but keep it up would mean intercept with bob, bob dies, generate sapling, so we're walling of our real boardpieces with that sapling that can block
- pass

## t5 p2
- add 4e to 4e
- draw: enforcer
> NOTE: hmmmm, play trigger, play lastborn, sac lastborn, gain 2e+1e, cheat exto out at 2e sale?? which is another kill for another energy? not that we have the board space by then lol. there are potential enforcer plays here too, to like snipe out composter first to then swing..? but probably not, right. oooh wait, not enough energy to lastborn after trigger, hm. trigger could still pop a dealer for 1e and a card..? hm. second sadist, but green wouldn't allow a death on our side there, and/or couldn't. very weak board. double lastborn doesn't help, they just won't block it, and even if they did we wouldn't have the energy to pop it. ah shit, enforcer play doesn't trigger dealer either, hm.
- trigger [2] for 3e (to 1e)
- trigger [2] effect to sac dealer [4]
  - trigger [2]: gain 2e (to 3e)
  - sadist [3]: gain 1e (to 4e)
  - dealer [5]: exhaust to draw 1 (diver)
- enforcer [1] for 2e (to 2e)
- enforcer [1]: exhaust (pay 2e to 0e) to ping composter [2] for 2
  - composter [2] dies
  - sadist [3]: gain 1e (to 1e)
- trigger [2] into face for 2
  - bob intercepts
    > NOTE: green thought here, gonna need space for saplings soon, might as well not take the face
    - bob dies
      - sadist [3]: gain 1e (to 2e)
        > NOTE: yeah should add a player indicator to the position notation
- pass

## t6 p1
- add 4e to 4e
- draw: mother
> NOTE: hmmm, we can get at least two saplings out this turn with double fieldhand. that burns _all_ the energy though, so mother is not just next turn, but two away. OTOH, fieldhand for a sap, pop with reaper, hope for something that lets us swing a bit more here..? hm. gamba.
- fieldhand [1] for 2e (to 2e)
  - fieldhand [1]: etb, play sapling [2]
- reaper [3]: exhaust to sac sapling [2], draw 2 (tender, tender)
  > NOTE: there we goooo. okay, we have a game on our hands. we could tender [2] to boost both on board, swing for... 4? or tender [4] to leave [5] open to sapling it next turn with fieldhand [2] -> sapling [5], to replace with syl, for a 2/3 syl boosted to 3/4 by tender... ah fuck, could be sniped of by enforcer though, hm; but we have the second tender. tender [4], fieldhand [2], sapling [5]? ah, can't sapling [5], no neighbour, so hrm, swap tender and sapling; would mean tender is on the corner but... maybe it's the play..?
- fieldhand [2] for 2e (to 2e)
  - fieldhand [2]: etb, play sapling [4]
- tender [5] for 2e (to 0e)
> NOTE: may as well swing with the hands, maybe reaper? sadist cant kill hands for energy, and probably want it undamaged either way, reaper would kill sadist but black would rather take 2 to face so eh. oh, only one, tender at [5], pants. ah, could we target something exhausted? hm. trigger would be a good contender, but it's at /3... enforcer is also /3, oof. dealer is not that interesting a target, but also /3...... yeah we can't kill shit, huh? and even if we do, black gains. yeah green feels weak statline wise now, or maybe we just lack removal. or was this misplays..? was there a better order here..? maybe the play was tender [2] to bump fieldhand and reaper, then fieldhand [5] sap [4] to prep a spot for syl next turn..? despite no tender boost? would at least have grown once.. hm. yeah i think that would have been stronger.
- fieldhand [1] into face for 1
  - p2 at 11
- fieldhand [2] into face for 1
  - p2 at 10
- reaper [3] into face for 1
  - p2 at 9
- pass
- sapling [4] grows to 0/2

## t7 p2
- add 4e to 6e
- draw: vandal
> NOTE: hm, various plays here; green probably wants to keep sap and tender, so an enforcer hit could be good. on either, really, maybe sap most of all, no more room for green to get one (oh, is that a bit of a deadlock? green's board fills up too much to create saplings?? maybe that needs to be addressed). lastborn for 2e, sac with trigger for 3e back, pay 2e for effect (total down 1e to 5e) to cheat out exto to kill something to go to 6e again (and get a draw trigger on dealer, damn), enforcer ping for 2, still at 4e. yeah, jesus. brutal.
- lastborn [4] for 2e (to 4e)
- trigger [2]: exhaust to sac lastborn for 2e (to 6e)
  - sadist [3]: gain 1e (to 7e)
  - dealer [5]: exhaust to draw 1 (vandal)
  - lastborn [2]: etg, pay 2e (to 5e) to play exto [4]
    - exo [4]: etb, green sacs fieldhand [1]
      - sadist [3]: gain 1e (to 6e)
        > NOTE: fuuuucking hell. should sadist be a [Once]??? it's going NUTS. that and/or trigger needs to come down.
~~- enforcer [1]: exhaust, pay 2e (to 4e), ping sapling [4] for 2~~
  > NOTE: oh shit nevermind! sapling grew, i forgot! it's at 1/3 now with tender! HM!
- enforcer [1]: exhaust, pay 2e (to 4e), ping tender [5]
  - tender [5] dies
  - sadist [3]: gain 1e (to 5e)
- exto [4] into face for 4
  - p1 at 9
- pass
> NOTE: yeah, hm. sadist at least needs to be toned down to only friendlies i think. makes more sense theme-wise too. both players have an interesting issue now where their boards are kinda clogged, but i think that would be alleviated later with actions. side-note: should sapling grow each end of turn..? the label is already unclear to be fair, but also, that would probably let green pop off some more.

## t8 p1
- add 4e to 4e
- draw: composter
> NOTE: yeah, green would really like to not have some of these creatures on board. maybe that's just green's destiny bound issue (that you'd alleviate by mixing with yellow/black?), but hm. we might want/need more creatures that play on top of each other here? could be kind of a green gimmick?
- tender [5] for 2e (to 2e)
- syl [4] (replacing sapling) for 1e (to 1e)
  - syl [4]: grows to 3/2 (then 4/3 with tender)
> NOTE: eugh, and yeah, green's statlines feel soso. even swinging face with fieldhand/reaper here is almost ignorable at 2 total, and trigger is obviously just gonna block syl, both die, black gains even _more_ energy. and green for sure needs a blocker up for exto here. hm; i think there's no other play than syl to face, trade with trigger, black gains 2e... yikes.
- syl [4] into face for 4
  - trigger [2] intercepts
    - both die
      - sadist [3]: gain 1e (to 6e)
        > NOTE: hm, wording on this is unclear, "whenever", so depends on if this is one or two instances of dying, since they're simultaneous? but to be consistent here, for now, 2
      - sadist [3]: gain 1e (to 7e)
- pass

## t9 p2
- add 4e to 11e
  > NOTE: holy fuck
- draw: agitator
  > NOTE: bruh. no space though.
> NOTE: lmao, you know what? maybe enforcer pings itself, dies, generates 1e (not that it matters, it's about the space on board), agitator, return infil for air swing, that's almost guaranteed then, no..? another 3 on the board and 2 in the air
- enforcer [1]: exhaust, pay 2 (to 9e), ping enforcer [1] for 2
  - enforcer [1] dies
    - sadist [3]: gain 1e (to 10e)
    > NOTE: hm, dealer or no dealer? maybe it's damage on board is more value than card right now
- agitator [1] for 6e (to 4e)
  - agitator [1]: etb, play infil [2] from gy by banishing security, scav, scav
- infil [2] into face for 2
  - p1 at 7
- agitator [1] into face for 3
  - fieldhand [2] blocks
    - agitator [1] to /2
    - fieldhand [2] dies
      - sadist [3]: gain 1e (to 5e)
        > NOTE: bruh
- exto [4] into face for 4
  - reaper [3] blocks
    - exto [4] to /2
    - reaper [3] dies
      - sadist [3]: gain 1e (to 6e)
- dealer [5] into face for 2
  - p1 at 5
- pass

## t10 p1
> NOTE: do or die
- add 4e to 5e
- draw: earthbreaker
> NOTE: hm? wait no, it generates so little, there's probably no play here, fuck. it would be like... earthbreaker [3], composter [2], swing compostor to put a token next to breaker for 1e, aaand we're bust. breaker [3], composter [4], swing boosted composter for 2, sapling [2], gain 1e, rip.
- earthbreaker [3] for 3e (to 2e)
- compostor [4] for 2e (to 0e)
~~- compostor [4] into face for 2~~
  - p2 at 7
  > NOTE: man, even swinging into something here doesn't help; like we... hm, wait, swing into interceptor, survive, four bodies on board..? wait that's playable
- composter [4] into interceptor [2] for 2
  - composter [4]: play sapling [2]
  - sadist [3] intercepts
    > NOTE: right. black does not at all need energy now, might as well block it, damn.
    - composter [4] to /1
    - sadist [3] dies
> NOTE: right, three bodies, composter is exhausted, still. hm.
- pass
- sapling [2] grows to 0/2

## t11 p2
- add 4e to... 10e? yeah.
- draw: enforcer
- vandal [3] for 2e (to 8e)
  > NOTE: yeah, obligatory block there or it's game with infil
- vandal [3] into face for 3
  - earthbreaker [3] intercepts
    - both die
- enforcer [3] for 2e (to 6e)
- enforcer [3]: exhaust, pay 2e, ping tender [5] for 2
  - tender [5] dies
- extortionist [4] into face for 4
  - sapling [2] intercepts
    - sapling [2] dies
- agitator [1] into face for 3
  - p1 at 2
- infil [2] into face for 2
  - game

# Exit notes

Yeah, hm. Well, for starters, Sadist is BUSTED lmao. Friendlies only. At least. Generally, Green _can't threaten_. Tweak some stat? Add a 3 cost Stampede with 3/3 trample or something? Removal?? An action like dust to dust, replace one of yours with a sapling, one of the opponents (of their choice?) with a sapling? Something needs to happen here. Maybe 5 wide board is too small? Green is getting very clogged. More play-over cards could be interesting too, cards that can be played cheap, but have to replace something? A little bit Pokemon up in here? Hm.
